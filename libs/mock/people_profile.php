Growing up in Dublin in the 1960s, Lynott fronted several bands as a lead vocalist, most notably Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with Whiskey in the Jar, the band found strong commercial success in the mid-1970s with hits such as \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\", \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"Waiting for an Alibi\\", and became a popular live attraction due to the combination of Lynott\\\'s vocal and songwriting skills and the use of dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott also embarked upon a solo career, published two books of poetry,[1] and after Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band Grand Slam, of which he was the leader until it folded in 1985.','video' => '','image' => '','tags' => '','facebook' => '','twitter' => '','facebookfanpage' => '','twitterfanpage' => '','instagram' => '','status' => '1','admin_id' => '1','conform' => '0','modifydate' => '0000-00-00','createdate' => '2014-06-13 09:09:09','postdate' => '0000-00-00 00:00:00','rejectreason' => '','shortdesc' => NULL,'twittershortdesc' => NULL,'slug' => 'phil-lynott'),

He was said to have legally obtained the house (now a ruin) but to have maintained his group of cattle through the theft of strays from neighbours. This would not be the only accusation made of Hutchinson.[1][2]

Shortly after Hutchinson\\\'s arrival in Jamaica, travellers began to disappear, and suspicion started to mount. For many miles, Edinburgh Castle was the only populated location on the way from Saint Ann\\\'s Bay and, not knowing that they would become the target of Hutchinson\\\'s rifle, travellers would rest at the castle, only to succumb to the Mad Doctor\\\'s attack. Hutchinson murdered for pure sport, what may be described as a thrill killing, as passers-by from all races, shapes, sizes, and incomes were fair game.[1][3]

What is true about Hutchinson\\\'s killings is debatable. He would shoot lone travellers and was said to feed on the flow of his victims\\\' blood as well as dismember them. He or, according to some sources, his slaves would then toss the remains in a cotton tree or a sinkhole for animals to feast on. That sinkhole became known as Hutchinson\\\'s Hole. At the height of his villainy, he would invite guests to his castle to be entertained before killing them. Hutchinson\\\'s reputation for debauchery made him notable as many would avoid him out of fear. His slaves\\\' tales of terrible treatment and the gruesome details of the murders made him legendary. This is why he was allowed to roam free for a time, until he shot an English soldier by the name of John Callendar, who attempted to apprehend Hutchison. After Hutchinson shot Callendar, he bolted south to Old Harbour and boarded a ship. The Royal Navy, commanded by Admiral Rodney, caught Hutchinson before he could escape. Shortly after being caught, he was tried and found guilty. In 1773, he was hanged in Spanish Town Square. Although the final toll is unknown, upon searching his home after his arrest, approximately 43 watches and a large amount of clothes were found. The records of his trial stand in the National Archives.','video' => '','image' => '','tags' => '','facebook' => '','twitter' => '','facebookfanpage' => '','twitterfanpage' => '','instagram' => '','status' => '1','admin_id' => '1','conform' => '0','modifydate' => '0000-00-00','createdate' => '2014-06-13 06:00:13','postdate' => '0000-00-00 00:00:00','rejectreason' => '','shortdesc' => NULL,'twittershortdesc' => NULL,'slug' => 'lewis-hutchinson'),

Due to their father\\\'s drug profits, Christopher and his siblings grew up amidst wealth and attended elite private schools. His sister and brother were killed in drug-related violence, in 1987 and 1992, respectively. Coke was gradually brought into his father\\\'s organization.

After his father\\\'s death in 1990, \\"Dudus\\" at the age of 21 became leader of the gang and also developed as the de facto leader of the Tivoli Gardens community in West Kingston. He developed community programs to help the poor and had so much local support that Jamaican police were unable to enter this neighborhood without community consent.[2]

Coke was arrested on drug charges and extradited to the United States (US) in 2010. His arrest had provoked violence among Coke\\\'s supporters in West Kingston. In 2011 Coke pled guilty to federal racketeering charges in connection with drug trafficking and assault. On 8 June 2012, he was sentenced by a Federal Court in New York City to 23 years in Federal prison.','video' => '','image' => '','tags' => 'Shower Posse, Dudus, jim brown, Tivoli gardens,','facebook' => '','twitter' => '','facebookfanpage' => '','twitterfanpage' => '','instagram' => '','status' => '1','admin_id' => '1','conform' => '0','modifydate' => '0000-00-00','createdate' => '2014-06-13 06:05:39','postdate' => '0000-00-00 00:00:00','rejectreason' => '','shortdesc' => NULL,'twittershortdesc' => NULL,'slug' => 'christopher-dudus-coke'),

After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish rappers became famous in the mainstream as well, such as Vico C and DJ Negro.[1] He has a unique, easy to listen to style of dance music and has produced many well known songs all over Latin America. His musical works have become popular in Latin America over the last few years.

John Williams had been freed by the will of his former master and within ten years was able to acquire property. As free blacks the Williams family were increasingly in the minority as Jamaica\\\'s sugar industry, which relied on the labour of enslaved Africans, grew over the course of the 18th century. Even less common were educated black people. However, John Williams\\\' independent wealth ensured that Francis and his brothers received an education.

A story later evolved suggesting that Francis was the subject of a social experiment devised by the Duke of Montagu who wished to show that black individuals - with the right education - could match the intellectual achievements of whites. The Duke is reported to have sponsored Francis to travel to England to undertake an English education at a grammar school and then at Cambridge University. However, Francis does not appear in the university\\\'s records and his family\\\'s wealth would have probably made the Duke\\\'s support unnecessary

The Jamaican born Ellis, a successful rock steady vocalist, had relocated permanently to London where he continued to be involved with reggae music and was looking for a female vocalist to record a reggae cover of Minnie Riperton\\\'s song, \\&quot;Lovin\\\' You\\&quot;.[3] In 1978 she recorded \\&quot;I Do Love You\\&quot; and \\&quot;That\\\'s What Friends Are For\\&quot;. The single \\&quot;Silly Games\\&quot;, written and produced by Dennis Bovell, was released in 1979 and became a hit across Europe and reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart.[4] The chart success of \\&quot;Silly Games\\&quot; led to appearances on Top of the Pops; the flagship music program of the BBC. She played the character Angel in the UK sitcom No Problem!; created by the Black Theatre Co-operative and broadcast on Channel 4 (1983–85). Whilst on the programme, she enjoyed a further club hit with \\&quot;Eternally Grateful\\&quot; in 1984, although the single never made the UK Top 100.

Kay has recorded, and co-produced her seventh album for Sony Music Japan. It was released on the 18 June 2003, and is entitled Lovin\\\' You … More. The popularity of the song \\&quot;Lovin\\\' You\\&quot; in Japan is so strong that she was asked to re-record it again for this album (for the third time). That version was produced by Omar.

\\&quot;Silly Games\\&quot; first hit the UK charts in 1979, and appeared again in 1990 as a re-recording billed as Lindy Layton featuring Janet Kay, which reached No. 22. A remix version of her original recording spent three weeks in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 62.[4][5]

Kay is credited as producer on \\&quot;Missing You\\&quot;, recorded by Aswad.','video' => '','image' => '','tags' => '','facebook' => '','twitter' => '','facebookfanpage' => '','twitterfanpage' => '','instagram' => '','status' => '1','admin_id' => '1','conform' => '0','modifydate' => '0000-00-00','createdate' => '2014-07-06 09:57:47','postdate' => '0000-00-00 00:00:00','rejectreason' => '','shortdesc' => NULL,'twittershortdesc' => NULL,'slug' => 'janet-kay'),

The Duchess gave Soubise a privileged life, treating him as if he were her own son - apparently with her husband Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry\\\'s blessing.[5]

Trained by Domenico Angelo (whom Soubise also regularly accompanied as usher to Eton and Windsor[5]), Soubise became the riding and fencing master to the Duchess.[1] He became popular among young noblemen and he rose as a figure in upper-class social circles, becoming the member of many fashionable clubs.[5] He was known as an amateur violinist,[2] singer and actor - he was taught oration by the famous actor David Garrick, who befriended a number of black people.[5] The personal favour and patronage of the Duchess allowed Soubise a lifestyle of womanizing and fashion. He would sometimes style himself \\&quot;Prince Ana-Ana-maboe\\&quot;[6] or \\&quot;The Black Prince\\&quot;, and claim to be African royalty.[7] It was rumoured that his relationship with the Duchess developed into a sexual one.[8][9]

Soubise became socially prominent enough to be the likely or definite subject of several caricatures - William Austin\\\'s well-known satirical engraving, The Duchess of Queensbury and Soubise (published 1 May 1773, showing them engaged in a fencing match);[5][10] and most notably, A Mungo Macaroni (published 10 September 1772), part of a famous 1771-73 satirical series of engravings depicting fashionable young men, published by Matthew and Mary Darly[11][12] (\\&quot;macaroni\\&quot; was a contemporary name for a fashionable young man  \\&quot;BATTY MAN\\&quot;; \\&quot;Mungo\\&quot; was a name of an officious slave from the 1769 comic opera The Padlock by Isaac Bickerstaffe; the Darly engraving was based on a caricature drawn by Henry Angelo).[13]

In the collected letters of the famous freed slave Ignatius Sancho, Letter XIIII dated 11 October 1771 is addressed to Soubise, whom Sancho encourages to consider his lucky position as an unusually privileged black person and so live a more seemly life.[12]

However, on 15 July 1777, Soubise fled Britain for India.[4] The Duchess died two days after his departure. In India, he founded a riding school in Calcutta, Bengal. Soubise died on 25 August 1798, from injuries sustained from falling off a horse.[4][14]

Rhone, starring Jimmy Cliff. Henzell also shot some footage for what was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder\\\'s aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, and the lack of finance for further production, he went on to become a writer, publishing his first novel, Power Game, in 1982.[5] Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place Like Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O\\\'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.
